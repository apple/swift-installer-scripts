## ðŸ“¦ The DEB Packaging Systems

Welcome to the world of DEB packaging systems! This README provides an overview of the packaging systems that utilize .deb files, namely `apt` and `dpkg`.

### What is a DEB Package?

A DEB (Debian) package is a software distribution format that contains application files, metadata, and installation instructions. DEB packages are used by Debian-based Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu.

### ðŸ”„ APT (Advanced Package Tool)

**APT (Advanced Package Tool)** is a powerful package management tool that simplifies the process of installing, upgrading, and removing software on Debian-based systems. It works seamlessly with DEB packages and resolves dependencies automatically.

#### Basic APT Commands:

- `sudo apt-get update`: Refreshes the package index.
- `sudo apt-get upgrade`: Upgrades installed packages to their latest versions.
- `sudo apt-get install <package>`: Installs a new package.
- `sudo apt-get remove <package>`: Uninstalls a package.
- `sudo apt-get autoremove`: Removes unused dependencies.

### ðŸ“¦ DPKG (Debian Package)

**DPKG (Debian Package)** is the low-level package manager that handles the installation and removal of DEB packages. It is the underlying tool for APT but can be used directly for managing packages.

#### Basic DPKG Commands:

- `sudo dpkg -i <package.deb>`: Installs a DEB package.
- `sudo dpkg -r <package>`: Removes an installed package.
- `sudo dpkg -l`: Lists installed packages.

### Getting Started:

1. **Installing Packages**:
   - Use `sudo apt-get install <package>` to install packages and let APT handle dependencies.

2. **Managing Individual Packages**:
   - Use `sudo dpkg -i <package.deb>` for direct installation using DPKG.

3. **Keeping System Updated**:
   - Regularly run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` to ensure your system and packages are up-to-date.
