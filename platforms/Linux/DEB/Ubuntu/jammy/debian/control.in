Description: Compiler toolchain for the Swift programming language
  Swift is a general-purpose programming language built using
  a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design
  patterns.
  The goal of the Swift project is to create the best available
  language for uses ranging from systems programming, to mobile
  and desktop apps, scaling up to cloud services. Most
  importantly, Swift is designed to make writing and maintaining
  correct programs easier for the developer.
  This package contains the convenience symlinks for the latest
  version of Swift.
