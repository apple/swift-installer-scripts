## ðŸ“¦ The RPM Packaging Systems

Welcome to the world of RPM packaging systems! This README provides an overview of the packaging systems that utilize .rpm files, namely `yum` and `dnf`.

### What is an RPM Package?

An RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) package is a software distribution format that contains application files, metadata, and installation instructions. RPM packages are used by Red Hat-based Linux distributions, such as Fedora and CentOS.

### ðŸ”„ YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)

**YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)** is a high-level package management tool that simplifies the process of installing, upgrading, and removing software on Red Hat-based systems. It works seamlessly with RPM packages and resolves dependencies automatically.

#### Basic YUM Commands:

- `sudo yum update`: Refreshes the package index.
- `sudo yum upgrade`: Upgrades installed packages to their latest versions.
- `sudo yum install <package>`: Installs a new package.
- `sudo yum remove <package>`: Uninstalls a package.
- `sudo yum autoremove`: Removes unused dependencies.

### ðŸ”„ DNF (Dandified YUM)

**DNF (Dandified YUM)** is the next-generation version of YUM, offering improved performance and additional features. It serves as a package manager on modern Red Hat-based systems.

#### Basic DNF Commands:

- `sudo dnf update`: Refreshes the package index.
- `sudo dnf upgrade`: Upgrades installed packages to their latest versions.
- `sudo dnf install <package>`: Installs a new package.
- `sudo dnf remove <package>`: Uninstalls a package.
- `sudo dnf autoremove`: Removes unused dependencies.

### Getting Started:

1. **Installing Packages**:
   - Use `sudo yum/dnf install <package>` to install packages and let YUM/DNF handle dependencies.

2. **Managing Individual Packages**:
   - Use `sudo rpm -i <package.rpm>` for direct installation using RPM.
   - Alternatively, use `sudo yum/dnf install <package.rpm>` for dependency resolution.

3. **Keeping System Updated**:
   - Regularly run `sudo yum/dnf update` to ensure your system and packages are up-to-date.
